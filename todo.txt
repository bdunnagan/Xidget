Areas For Improvement

Construction, Tag-processing and Xidget-Widget Association

  . Multiple uses of a xidget via insert tags does not work.
  . Tag-processing should support scripted modification of configuration prior to creation.
  . Xidget-Widget association may not be robust due to insert tags.  

Layout

  . Need more options for laying out labels.
  . setComputedSize() should not change default size.
  . Set Swing LayoutManager to null, and put layout in lifecycle.

Contexts

  . Using global collections is cumbersome, but better than relying on global variables.
  . Named contexts may be confusing.
  . Need easier, intuitive way to share information between two xidget configurations.
