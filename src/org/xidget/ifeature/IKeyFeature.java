/**
 * An interface for interpreting and handling key bindings. This interface is defined in terms
 * of a xidget-specific key sequence string and an IXAction to be executed when the key sequence
 * is pressed. The key sequence string consists of one or more modifiers separated by a "+" sign
 * followed by one or more primary keys separated by commas. The modifiers are separated by a 
 * comma from the primary keys. For example, the key sequence string, "shift+control,a,b", contains
 * two modifiers and two primaries.
 * <p>
 * This interface defines the key strings for all non-printable characters. These strings should 
 * be referenced by the platform implementation of xidgets to provide a xidget-specific, cross-
 * platform mechanism for defining key bindings.
