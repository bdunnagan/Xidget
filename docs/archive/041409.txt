1. The tag handler for the xidget tag should create a factory.

2. The factory should create the features required to customize the xidget.

3. The factory can create exactly the xidgets that are needed based on information in the configuration.

4. The factory is responsible for creating the features in the correct order, according to their dependency graph.

5. The factory may even create the widget and hand it to all the features.

6. The xidget does not need the startConfig and endConfig methods.  What defines a xidget is the fact
   that it may have a parent and/or children and that it is associated with a configuration element
   and a factory.  The xidget should retain a reference to both of these.
