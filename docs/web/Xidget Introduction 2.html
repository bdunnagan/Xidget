<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
The moniker, "xidget", refers to an xml schema for representing user-interfaces and associated business logic. A reference 
implementation of the schema is provided in Java and Swing. Currently, I am weighing the relative importance of SWT
versus C++/QT implementation. A xidget user-interface specification contains both the user-interface description and 
business logic encoded in xml scripts. Xidgets rely heavily on XPath expressions. The xml scripting language is a succinct 
means of coding the user-interface business logic. The scripting language is designed so that it is easy to extend the 
language with native code. In many cases, all of the functionality of a user-interface component can be described in a single 
xml file, including the complete user-interface description, all business logic, as well as complex behaviors such as 
drag-and-drop and undo/redo.</p>
<p>
The simplest xidget is probably a text xidget.  Here is a sample:</p>

<div class="xml">
<pre>
  &lt;text&gt;
    &lt;label&gt;'Login'&lt;/label&gt;
    &lt;source&gt;authentication/login&lt;/source&gt;
  &lt;/text&gt;
</pre>
</div>

<p>
For convenience, most xidgets support a label element that defines a label to appear to the immediate left of the xidget.  Notice
that the content of the <i>label</i> element is an XPath string literal expression.  The <i>source</i> element contains an XPath 
expression that identifies the node that contains the content of the text widget.  Xidgets support a subset of the XPath 2.0 
specification.  The framework guarantees that the content of the node identified by the <i>source</i> expression will reflect
the content of the text widget.  XPath expressions can be arbitrarily complex.</p>
<p>
Since xidgets are defined with XPath expressions, application data must be represented in a hierarchical model.  The xidget 
framework includes a technique for representing arbitrarily large hierarchical models, where a subset of the data is resident
in memory. This is called <i>virtual xml</i> because all data-sources accessed by the user-interface may appear to be a single
enormous xml document accessible by xpath expressions. The framework guarantees that data which is currently displayed is memory 
resident, while allowing the developer to make decisions about how data is loaded into memory and how much memory is allocated 
to each entity. The problem of caching data into memory is completely separate from, and transparent to xidgets.</p>
