<h2>The Xidget Lifecycle</h2>

<h4>Xidget Creation</h4>
<p>
Xidget creation consists of the following stages: <b>Creation</b>, <b>Initialization</b>, <b>Construction</b>, <b>Binding</b> 
and <b>Visibility</b>. A xidget is created by calling the <i>createXidget</i> script element. A xidget is associated with a single 
xpath context that is supplied to the <i>createXidget</i> script, and the xpaths in the xidget configuration are bound to this 
context when the xidget is bound.</p>
<p>
The <b>Creation</b> stage involves instantiating an implementation of the <i>IXidget</i> interface based on a configuration element.
The mapping of the implementation of <i>IXidget</i> to a configuration element may be defined in the xidget base package, in the
xidget toolkit implementation, or in a user-defined plugin.</p>
<p>
Once the xidget class has been instantiated, the <i>onOpen</i> script is called. At this point, the xpaths within the xidget configuration 
have not yet been bound to the xidget context. This means, among other things, that the script can create xml fragments and assign them
to variables that are referenced by xpaths in the xidget configuration.</p>
<p>
After the <i>onOpen</i> script is called, the widget hierarchy is built, but the widget hierarchy is not made visible until after the
xidget is bound to its context. Thus, a widget will be populated based on its xidget xpaths before it becomes visible.</p>

<h4>Xidget Destruction</h4>
<p>
Similarly, the xidget destruction consists of the following stages: <b>Visibility</b>, <b>Binding</b>, <b>Destruction</b>, 
<b>Finalization</b> and <b>Deletion</b>. These stages can be understood by symmetry with the process of creation.</p>
