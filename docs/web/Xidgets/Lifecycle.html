<h2>The Xidget Lifecycle</h2>

<h4>Xidget Creation</h4>
<p>
Xidget creation consists of the following stages: <b>Creation</b>, <b>Initialization</b>, <b>Construction</b>, <b>Binding</b> 
and <b>Visibility</b>. A xidget is created by calling the <i>createXidget</i> script element. A xidget is associated with a single 
xpath context that is supplied to the <i>createXidget</i> script, and the xpaths in the xidget configuration are bound to this 
context when the xidget is bound.</p>

<h5>Creation</h5>
<p>
The first step in xidget creation is instantiating an implementation of the <i>IXidget</i> interface based on a configuration element.
The mapping of the implementation of <i>IXidget</i> to a configuration element may be defined in the xidget base package, in the
xidget toolkit implementation, or in a user-defined plugin.</p>

<h5>Initialization</h5>
<p>
Once the xidget class has been instantiated, the <i>onOpen</i> script is called. At this point, the xpaths within the xidget configuration 
have not yet been bound to the xidget context. This means, among other things, that the script can create xml fragments and assign them
to variables that are referenced by xpaths in the xidget configuration.</p>

<h5>Construction</h5>
<p>
After the <i>onOpen</i> script is called, the platform-specific widgets in the complete widget hierarchy are constructed. Each
implementation of the IXidget interface knows how to create its associated widget based solely on the content of the configuration.
The widget hierarchy is not visible at this stage.</p>

<h5>Binding</h5>
<p>
After the widget hierarchy is constructed, the xpath expressions in each xidget configuration are bound to the xidget's context.
As xidget expressions are bound, the widget properties are specified including labels, images, colors and fonts, and enumerable
other properties. <i>Triggers</i> are also bound during this stage, and therefore can tweak the widget before it becomes visible.
A trigger whose <i>initialize</i> attribute is set true behaves similarly to an <i>onOpen</i> event except that it is invoked
after the widget is created.</p> 

<h5>Visibility</h5>
<p>
The last step in the process is to make the widget hierarchy visible. After this point, triggers may fire in response to user
widget interaction.</p>


<h4>Xidget Destruction</h4>
<p>
Similarly, the xidget destruction consists of the following stages: <b>Visibility</b>, <b>Binding</b>, <b>Destruction</b>, 
<b>Finalization</b> and <b>Deletion</b>. These stages can be understood by symmetry with the process of creation. In particular,
triggers whose <i>finalize</i> attribute is set true will fire when the xidget is unbound, after the widget is hidden but before
the widget is destroyed. The <i>onClose</i> script is called after the widget hierarchy is destroyed.</p>
