<h2>Trigger Script</h2>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
The <i>trigger</i> script is a script which is executed when an event occurs in the datamodel. There
are three types of triggers: condition triggers, node triggers and entity triggers. A condition trigger
fires when its condition expression becomes true. A node trigger fires when any one of the nodes in
the expression node-set is updated. Node triggers are shallow listeners. In contrast, an entity trigger
is a deep listener and it fires whenever any part of the subtree of any node in the expression node-set
changes.</p>
<p>
Before node or entity triggers execute their scripts, they define useful variables in the current context
that tell the script what has changed. Node triggers set the <i>added</i> variable to the child that was
added to the target element. The <i>removed</i> variable is set to the child that was removed from the
target element.</p>
