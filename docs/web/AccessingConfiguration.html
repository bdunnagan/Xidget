<h2>Accessing Configuration Files</h2>
<p>
When the <i><a href="MainScript.html">main</a></i> script is executed, the context of the script is an 
<a href="HowToUseExternalReferences.html">external reference</a> with a caching policy that provides access 
to the root of the configuration file-system. If the application was executed from a jar file, then the 
caching policy will be a ZipCachingPolicy. If the application was executed from a Java class file in the 
local file-system, then the caching policy will be a FileSystemCachingPolicy. In either case, the external
reference points to the root of the configuration. One of the first things that the main script should do
is store the context in a variable so that it may be referenced later from different contexts.</p>
<p>
The FileSystemCachingPolicy and ZipCachingPolicy classes convert their respective hierarchical file-systems
into virtual xml documents with the same hierarchical structure. This allows the file-system to be queried
by xpath. There are limitations, however. The official xml DOM does not allow element names to contain spaces 
or many other special characters that are allowed in the file-system - these constraints exist because of the
lexical structure of XML. The xidget DOM does not place any restrictions on element names if they are generated
programmatically (by a caching policy). Location steps involving these types of files must be handled with a 
wildcard element name and a predicate.  The xpath language is sufficiently general to allow any name to be 
identified by a predicate.</p>
<p style="color: #a00000;">
It is recommended that configuration files and folders use names that are supported by the official xml DOM
(no spaces or special characters) so that they can easily be accessed via xpath. Periods are allowed.</p>
<p>
The following example shows a typical main script. The root of the application configuration contains
two directories, <i>images</i> and <i>xml</i>, which contain the images, and the xidget configuration
files and scripts, respectively. These two folders have been saved in variables so that they can be
accessed later from different contexts.</p>

<div class="xml">
&lt;script name="The Main Script"&gt;
  &lt;package&gt;org.xidget.xaction&lt;/package&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- initialize plugins --&gt;
  &lt;plugin&gt;'org.xidget.builder.Plugin'&lt;/plugin&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- The environment. --&gt;
  &lt;create assign="env"&gt;
    &lt;template annotated="true"&gt;
      &lt;env&gt;
        &lt;extern:cache class="org.xmodel.external.caching.EnvironmentCachingPolicy"/&gt;
      &lt;/env&gt;
    &lt;/template&gt;
  &lt;/create&gt;
  
  &lt;assign name="images"&gt;images&lt;/assign&gt;
  &lt;assign name="xml"&gt;xml&lt;/assign&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- custom xpath library --&gt;
  &lt;invoke&gt;$xml/xpath/functions.xml/*&lt;/invoke&gt;
  
  &lt;!-- start application --&gt;
  &lt;createXidget assign="window"&gt;$xml/Application.xml/*&lt;/createXidget&gt;
&lt;/script&gt;
</div> 

<h4>Using Images</h4>
<p>
When a ZipCachingPolicy or FileSystemCachingPolicy encounters a file, it creates an external reference with a caching
policy appropriate for the file based on its extension. Image files are given a caching policy which embeds the image
data into the virtual xml document. The semantics of this behavior are platform-specific, but the result is that 
xidget parameters that require images can be supplied with an image external reference via an xpath that addresses
an image file in the file-system.</p>
<p>
The following example shows a button xidget whose image comes from the images folder that was stored in the $images
variable in the previous main script.</p>

<div class="xml">
&lt;button&gt;
  &lt;image&gt;static( $images/undo.gif)&lt;/image&gt;
  &lt;onPress&gt;
    &lt;print&gt;'Undo'&lt;/print&gt;
  &lt;/onPress&gt;
&lt;/button&gt;
</div>

<p>
The <i>static</i> xpath function is an optimization. It tells the framework that the result of the xpath will never
change and avoids the overhead of binding the data-model to the expression argument.</p>
