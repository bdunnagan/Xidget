	  <h4>What is a Xidget?</h4>
	  <p>A xidget is an fragment of XML that describes a graphical user-interface component (widget). Every visual and behavioral
	     characteristic of a widget is defined by an XPath expression, and is updated whenever the result of the XPath expression
	     changes.</p>
	     
	  <h4>What user-interface toolkits are supported?</h4>
	  <p>The reference implementation of xidgets was programmed with Java 1.6 with a binding for the Swing widget toolkit. Bindings
	     for C#/WinForms and C++/Qt are in progress.</p>
	     
	  <h4>What is required to begin using xidgets?</h4>
	  <p> Eclipse Java IDE, Java 1.6+ and Subversion 1.6.</p>
	  
	  <h4>Is the xidget framework extensible?</h4>
	  <p>Yes. The xidget framework was designed to be extensible in three areas: widgets, scripting and data-model.</p>
	  
	  <h4>What are the terms of the software license?</h4>
	  <p>Xidgets are distributed under the <a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.html"><u>Apache 2.0 software license agreement</u></a> 
	     which allows individuals and companies to develop and market proprietary software that uses the xidget libraries. However, any 
	     modifications to the xidget libraries are open-source.</p>
