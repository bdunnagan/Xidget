<span id="Introduction">
<p>
Xidgets are a new Java framework for developing user-interfaces in Swing, SWT or any other widget toolkit (currently, only Swing 
is supported). A xidget user-interface specification contains both the user-interface description and business logic encoded in xml 
scripts. Xidgets rely heavily on XPath expressions. The xml scripting language is intended to be the most succinct means of coding 
the user-interface business logic. The scripting language is designed so that it is easy to extend the language with Java classes.  
In many cases, all of the functionality of a dialog (for example) can be described in a single xml file, including the complete 
user-interface description, all business logic, as well as complex behaviors such as drag-and-drop and undo/redo.</p>
<p>
The simplest xidget is probably a text xidget.  Here is a sample:

<div class="code">
  <text>
    <label>'Login'</label>
    <source>authentication/login</source>
  </text>
</div>

For convenience, most xidgets support a label element that defines a label to appear to the immediate left of the xidget.  Notice
that the content of the <i>label</i> element is an XPath string literal expression.  The <i>source</i> element contains an XPath 
expression that identifies the node that contains the content of the text widget.  Xidgets support a subset of the XPath 2.0 
specification.  The framework guarantees that the content of the node identified by the <i>source</i> expression will reflect
the content of the text widget.  XPath expressions can be arbitrarily complex.</p>
<p>
Since xidgets are defined with XPath expressions, application data must be represented in a hierarchical model.  The xidget 
framework includes a technique for representing arbitrarily large hierarchical models, where a subset of the data is resident
in memory.  The framework guarantees that data which is currently displayed is memory resident, while allowing the developer
to make decisions about how data is loaded into memory and how much memory is allocated to each entity.  The problem of caching
data into memory is completely separate from, and transparent to xidgets.</p>
