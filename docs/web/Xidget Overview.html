          <h4>Introduction</h4>
          <p>
          Xidgets are an xml schema for representing user-interfaces and associated business logic. A xidget user-interface specification 
          contains both the user-interface description and business logic encoded in xml scripts. Xidgets rely heavily on XPath expressions. 
          The xml scripting language is a succinct means of coding the user-interface business logic. The scripting language is designed so 
          that it is easy to extend the language with native code. In many cases, all of the functionality of a user-interface component can 
          be described in a single xml file, including the complete user-interface description, all business logic, as well as complex behaviors 
          such as drag-and-drop and undo/redo.</p>
          <p>
          The simplest xidget is probably a text xidget.  Here is a sample:</p>
          
          <div class="xml">
          <pre>
            &lt;text&gt;
              &lt;label&gt;'Login'&lt;/label&gt;
              &lt;source&gt;authentication/login&lt;/source&gt;
            &lt;/text&gt;
          </pre>
          </div>
          
          <p>
          For convenience, most xidgets support a label element that defines a label to appear to the immediate left of the xidget.  Notice
          that the content of the <i>label</i> element is an XPath string literal expression.  The <i>source</i> element contains an XPath 
          expression that identifies the node that contains the content of the text widget.  Xidgets support a subset of the XPath 2.0 
          specification.  The framework guarantees that the content of the node identified by the <i>source</i> expression will reflect
          the content of the text widget.  XPath expressions can be arbitrarily complex.</p>
          <p>
          Since xidgets are defined with XPath expressions, application data must be represented in a hierarchical model.  The xidget 
          framework includes a technique for representing arbitrarily large hierarchical models, where a subset of the data is resident
          in memory. This is called <i>virtual xml</i> because all data-sources accessed by the user-interface may appear to be a single
          enormous xml document accessible by xpath expressions. The framework guarantees that data which is currently displayed is memory 
          resident, while allowing the developer to make decisions about how data is loaded into memory and how much memory is allocated 
          to each entity. The problem of caching data into memory is completely separate from, and transparent to xidgets.</p>
