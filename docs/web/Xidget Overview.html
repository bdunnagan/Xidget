<h2>Introduction To Xidgets</h2>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
<i>Xidget</i> is short for Xml Widget. A xidget is an xml element that defines the appearance and behavior of a widget. So
why do we need another xml widget schema? The main difference between xidgets and other xml widget schemas is that xidgets
leverage the Java Advanced Hierarchical Model (JAHM) framework. JAHM makes it possible for Java code to receive notification
when the result of an arbitrary xpath expression changes. In the context of the xidget framework, JAHM makes it possible for
the xidget schema to implement a bi-directional transform between the visual representation of data and the data-model. This
technique is particularly powerful when defining complex widgets such as tables and trees.</p>
<p>
JAHM also provides an extensible framework for caching external data from the network, a database, the file-system, or any
other external data source. A <i>caching policy</i> determines when, and how much, data is cached in memory. The
<i>caching policy</i> also defines how data is transformed into xml so that xpath expressions can access the data. For
more information on caching policies see <a href="HowToUseExternalReferences.html">How To Use External References</a>.</p>
<p>
The xidget schema also includes a simple, extensible scripting language which is designed for scripting the business logic
in a xidget application. Each element in a xidget script corresponds to a Java class that implements the <i>IXAction</i>
interface. Extending the scripting language is as simple as implementing this interface (or more often by extending the 
<i>GuardedAction</i> class), and including a <i>package</i> reference in your xidget configuration. The <i>package</i>
reference contains the name of the Java package to which the implementation belongs.</p>
<p>
The simplest xidget application consists of two xml files. The first file is the main script. This name of this script
is passed as an argument to the Main class which is part of the xidget toolkit for a particular widget platform. 
See <a href="Main Script.html">The Main Script</a> for more information. The second xml file will contain a <i>window</i> 
xidget configuration. The last line of the main script will call the <a href="Scripting/CreateXidget.html"><i>createXidget</i></a> 
script element and supply the path of the <i>window</i> xidget configuration, as well as a context element to which the <i>window</i> 
xidget will be bound. For more information on binding and the xidget lifecycle see 
<a href="Xidgets/Lifecycle.html">The Xidget Lifecycle</a>.</p>
