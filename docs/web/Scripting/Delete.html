<h2><i>delete</i></h2>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
The <i>delete</i> script element removes one or more elements from their respective parents. It is important
to note that the deleted elements may still be referenced by variables. The element is not necessarily
"gone forever". It has only been removed from the model in which it resided.</p>
<p>
In addition, the element may still be bound
to one or more xpaths if the context in which the xpath was bound resided within the sub-tree of the element.
If, and only if, the element is reachable from the context in which the xpath was bound then the element will 
still be bound to the xpath.</p>
