<h2><i>set</i></h2>
<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
The set script element sets the value of a node. If the node is an
attribute then the attribute value
is set. If the node is an element then the element text is set. The
source xpath is string evaluated
and used to set the value of each of the nodes in the target node-set.
If the target xpath does not
return any nodes, and the target xpath ends in one or more location
steps then an element is created
for each location step that does not return at least one node.</p>

<p>
The schema of many of the script elements is flexible, allowing the
user to choose a convention that
appeals to them. Many of the script elements operate on so-called
source and target elements. In every
case, the schema allows the source or target xpath to be defined in an
attribute, in an element, or as
the value of the script element. If the source xpath is defined as the
value of a script element then
the target must be defined as an attribute, and vice versa.</p>

<h4>Basic Assignment</h4>
<p>
The following example sets the <i>author</i> element of a book:</p>

<div class="xml">
&lt;set source="'Frank Wilzcek'"&gt;collection('library')/books/book[ title='The Lightness of Being']/author&lt;/set&gt;
</div>

<p>
The following example sets the <i>id</i> attribute of an element.</p>

<div class="xml">
&lt;set source="$id"&gt;collection('library')/books/book[ title='The Lightness of Being']/@id&lt;/set&gt;
</div>

<p><b>Note:</b><br/>
In general the <i>id</i> attribute should be assigned before an
element is parented, so that the element has an identity
when it becomes accessible.</p>
<p>
The following example sets the <i>status</i> attribute of every book
in the library collection.</p>

<div class="xml">
&lt;set source="'reserved'"&gt;collection('library')/books/book/@status&lt;/set&gt;
</div>
