<h2><i>copy</i></h2>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
The <i>copy</i> script element copies information from one sub-tree to another using
a customizable differencing engine. The differencing engine insures that only the data
that has changed is updated in the target sub-tree. When the user-interface has views
onto the target data, removing the target sub-tree and replacing it with a copy of 
the source sub-tree will often have visual side-effects.  For example, suppose the
information in the target sub-tree is displayed in a tree xidget. If you remove the
target sub-tree, the visual tree will disappear.  This is too coarse an update if
only a few nodes in the tree have changed.</p>
