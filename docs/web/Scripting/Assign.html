<h2><i>assign</i></h2>

<h4>Overview</h4>
<p>
The assign script element assigns the result of an xpath to a variable in the context scope.
Any of the xpath return types may be assigned to a variable. There is a difference between
assigning variables using the assign script element and assigning variables using a <i>let</i>
clause within an xpath. A <i>let</i> clause only defines the variable within the scope of the
xpath in which it occurs, while the <i>assign</i> script element assigns the variable within
the current context so that it can be accessed later by other script elements.</p>
<p>
The <i>mode</i> attribute 
provides several options for transforming a node-set before it is assigned. The most common
use of this attribute is to make a deep copy of the node-set. If the <i>mode</i> attribute 
is set to <i>ref</i> then a reference to the element is assigned to the variable. A reference 
behaves exactly like the element it references with the exception that it has a different 
parent (see the documentation on references for more information).</p>
<p>
Although it is possible to append nodes to a node-set in a variable using the xpath union
operator, the <i>append</i> attribute will do the same thing with the advantage that,
unlike the union operator, the same node can appear in the node-set twice.</p>
<p>
If the <i>define</i> attribute is true then xpath, itself, will be assigned to the variable.
This is useful if you do not want the xpath to be evaluated immediately.  The xpath will be
evaluated when the variable is used.</p>

<h4>Basic Assignment</h4>
<p>
The following example assigns a string literal to a variable.</p>

<div class="xml">
&lt;assign name="x"&gt;&apos;I am a big nerd.&apos;&lt;/assign&gt;
</div>

<p>
The next example assigns a node-set to a variable.</p>

<div class="xml">
&lt;assign name="x"&gt;collection('library')/books/book[ title=&apos;The Lightness of Being&apos;]&lt;/assign&gt;
</div>

<p>
The next example makes a deep copy of the node-set before assigning it to the variable.</p>

<div class="xml">
&lt;assign name="x" mode="copy"&gt;collection('library')/books/book[ title=&apos;The Lightness of Being&apos;]&lt;/assign&gt;
</div>

<p>
The next example assigns all of the books in the library to the variable.</p>

<div class="xml">
&lt;assign name="x"&gt;collection('library')/books/book&lt;/assign&gt;
</div>

<h4>Using the <i>Append</i> Attribute</h4>
<p>
As mentioned above, the <i>append</i> attribute can be used to append new nodes to the node-set already assigned to a variable.</p>

<div class="xml">
&lt;assign name="x"&gt;collection('library')/books/book[ title=&apos;The Lightness of Being&apos;]&lt;/assign&gt;<br/>
&lt;assign name="x" append="true"&gt;collection('library')/books/book[ title=&apos;The Lightness of Being&apos;]&lt;/assign&gt;
</div>

<p>
After executing those statements the variable <i>x</i> will contain the same book element twice. After executing the next 
statements the node-set will only contain the book once because the union operator removes duplicate nodes.</p>

<div class="xml">
&lt;assign name="x"&gt;$x | collection('library')/books/book[ title=&apos;The Lightness of Being&apos;]&lt;/assign&gt;
</div>

<h4>Removing Duplicates with the Union Operator</h4>
<p>
The xpath union operator is a convenient way to remove duplicate nodes (and the only way since the framework is not
fully XPath 2.0 compliant yet ::sigh::).</p>

<div class="xml">
&lt;assign name="x"&gt;$x | empty()&lt;/assign&gt;
</div>

<h4>Using the <i>Define</i> Attribute</h4>
<p>
When the <i>define</i> attribute is true, the xpath, itself, is assigned to the variable. In this case the xpath is
not evaluated until the variable is used.</p>

<div class="xml">
&lt;assign name="y"&gt;'Value Before Assignment'&lt;/assign&gt;<br/>
&lt;assign name="x" define="true"&gt;$y&lt;/assign&gt;<br/>
&lt;assign name="y"&gt;'Value After Assignment'&lt;/assign&gt;<br/>
&lt;print&gt;$x&lt;/print&gt;
</div>

<p>
Executing these statements will print the following:</p>

<div class="xml">
<b>Value After Assignment</b>
</div>
