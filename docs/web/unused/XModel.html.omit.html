<h3><a name="Introduction">Introduction</a></h3>
<p>The XModel is a hierarchical data modeling framework written in Java with storage semantics similar
   to those described in the XML 1.0 specification. It differs from other XML data modeling frameworks
   in that it provides XPath-based data binding. The base of the implementation is XPath 1.0 compliant, 
   but several useful XPath 2.0 and XQuery 1.0 features have been implemented including <i>for/return</i>,
   <i>if/then/else</i> statements and <i>let</i> clauses. The data-binding framework exports a single
   listener interface which clients can implement and register with arbitrary XPath expressions. 
   Listeners are notified when the data-model is changed in any way which would cause the result of
   the XPath expression to change. Two interface callback methods tell the client when nodes are added
   to or removed from XPath expressions whose result type is a node-set.  There are also interface
   callback methods which notify the client when the value of a string, numeric or boolean XPath
   expression changes.
</p>

<p>The XModel provides a unique and powerful solution for Model/View/Controller architectures. It provides
   the glue which connects user-interface components (widgets) to the data-model utilizing the XPath language
   to perform transformations.
</p>

<h4><a name="XPath Listeners">XPath Listeners</a></h4>
<p>Intended for data-binding applications, the most important feature of the framework is the ability to add 
   listeners to an arbitrary XPath expressions. Consider the following expression:
</p>

<p class="code">collection('employees')/employee[ contains( title, 'Engineer')]/name</p>

<p>After this expession is bound to a listener, the listener will be notified of all employees whose title includes
   the word, "Engineer". If an engineering employee is added or removed from the document, or if an engineer becomes
   a manager, listeners will receive notification. The listener mechanism decouples the code which updates the model 
   from code which is interested in the content of the model.</p>

<p>Here is another example:</p>

<p class="code">
   for $title in collection('store')/catalog/cd[ author = 'Yes']/title<br/>
   return collection('store')/inventory/product[ title = $title]
</p>
  
<p>Listeners bound to this expression will receive notification when a change to the data-model would cause the
   expression's return value to change. For example, if a new album by <i>Yes</i> is added to the catalog, 
   listeners will be notified when the album is in stock. Listeners are constantly updated with the current set 
   of matching products. Clients may choose to receive <i>ordered</i> or <i>unordered</i> notification by choosing 
   the correct listener base class. Ordered notifications provide information about the location of new elements 
   in the node-set.
</p>

<p>The notification algorithm is designed to incur the majority of performance costs during binding and unbinding
   and is capable of providing timely notifications during mouse movement events or typing. For example, reasonably
   complex validation logic can be performed as the user types without a noticeable latency.
</p>

<h4><a name="XML Comparison">XML Comparison</a></h4>
<p>The framework includes a customizable xml differencing engine. An interface is provided for defining rules that
   govern the semantics of the comparison. A general purpose rule implementation is provided which can be used when
   the constraints are placed on the use of <i>id</i> attributes on elements.
</p>   

<p>In order to use the general purpose comparison rules, there must be a rule to establish the identity of each 
   element in the documents being compared. A trivial way to define the identity of an element is to provide a
   unique <i>id</i> attribute. It is cumbersome to maintain <i>id</i> attributes on all elements, however. 
   The identity of an element can be established in other ways. For example, if an element is known to be unique
   among its peers, or when an element and its peers form an ordered list. The following example illustrates the
   case where elements are unique among their peers.
</p>

<div class="column1">
  <pre><![CDATA[
    <parent>
      <child-a/>
      <child-b/>
      <child-c/>
    </parent> 
  ]]></pre>
</div>
<div class="column2">
  <pre><![CDATA[
    <parent>
      <child-a/>
      <child-c/>
    </parent> 
  ]]></pre>
</div>

<p style="clear:both">
Comparing these two fragments will create a change record indicating that the element <i>child-b</i> was removed
from the first fragment in the second fragment. Reversing the order of the comparison would generate a record
indicating that the element <i>child-b</i> was added to the second fragment.
</p>

<p>The next example illustrates the case where non-unique elements occur in an ordered list.</p>

<div class="column1">
  <pre><![CDATA[
    <parent>
      <child>1</child>
      <child>2</child>
      <child>3</child>
    </parent> 
  ]]></pre>
</div>
<div class="column2">
  <pre><![CDATA[
    <parent>
      <child>1</child>
      <child>3</child>
    </parent> 
  ]]></pre>
</div>

<p style="clear:both">
Comparing these two fragments will create a change record indicating that the second child element has been 
removed. This is because the general-purpose comparison rules will test the value of elements which do not
have an <i>id</i> attribute and are part of an ordered list. The specification of the set of elements whose
children form ordered-lists must be provided.
</p>

<p>
The next example illustrates the case where identity is defined by the <i>id</i> attribute and the children
do not comprise an ordered list.
</p>

<div class="column1">
  <pre><![CDATA[
    <parent>
      <child id="1"/>
      <child id="2"/>
      <child id="3"/>
    </parent> 
  ]]></pre>
</div>
<div class="column2">
  <pre><![CDATA[
    <parent>
      <child id="1"/>
      <child id="3"/>
    </parent> 
  ]]></pre>
</div>

<p style="clear:both">
The general purpose comparison rules will use the <i>id</i> attribute to establish the identity of an element
when it is present.
</p>

<p>
Documents which do not conform to these semantics can still be compared provided that suitable rules for
establishing the identity of elements in the documents are provided. Rules can also be provided as caveats
to the general-purpose rules. The rules are captured in an implementation of the <i>IXmlMatcher</i> interface
which is supplied to the <i>XmlDiffer</i> class.
</p>

<p>
One case in which it is always necessary to customize the comparison rules is when the identity of an element
is determined by complex content. The next example illustrates this case.
</p>

<div class="column1">
  <pre><![CDATA[
    <parent>
      <child>
        <content>1</content>
      </child>
      <child>
        <content>2</content>
      </child>
      <child>
        <content>3</content>
      </child>
    </parent> 
  ]]></pre>
</div>
<div class="column2">
  <pre><![CDATA[
    <parent>
      <child>
        <content>1</content>
      </child>
      <child>
        <content>3</content>
      </child>
    </parent> 
  ]]></pre>
</div>

<p style="clear:both">
The ultimate goal of providing comparison rules is to minimize the number of records in a <i>ChangeSet</i>.
The complexity of document comparison is constant-time with respect to the number of elements in the documents
except for unordered-list comparison which is n*log(n). By minimizing the change records produced, document
comparison is highly efficient.
</p>

<h4><a name="External Data Sources and Caching">External Data Sources and Caching</a></h4>
<p>
Application data-models usually must interface with one or more external data sources such as the local
file-system or database. When working with large amounts of data, the application often cannot hold all
of the data in memory and a caching strategy must be employed. One significant advantage of using an
interface to represent an element in the data-model, is that the interface can be implemented to access
data on demand. The framework provides such an implementation along with a secondary interface that 
governs the caching strategy.
</p>   

<p>
Any XPath expression which accesses an element in a document from a context outside of the element, itself,
will always access the parent of the element. Therefore, the implementation of <i>IModelObject</i> of the 
parent has an opportunity to cache the element fragment on demand. This contract is defined by a 
sub-interface of <i>IModelObject</i> called <i>IExternalReference</i>. The <i>IExternalReference</i> interface,
in turn, is associated with an instance of <i>ICachingPolicy</i> which defines the caching strategy. This
is an powerful mechanism for hiding the details of data access and caching from the application. The application
can interact with the data-model using XPath expressions without any knowledge of the caching strategies.
</p>

<p>
The xml differencing engine allows the caching policy to update its cached fragment with a minimal set of 
changes that the application can observe through its bound XPath expressions. When the cached data is not
bound by any XPath expressions, the caching strategy can choose to update the cached data, or simply discard
the cached data and access on demand the next time the application makes a request for it (usually via XPath).
</p>

<p>
In addition to the <i>ICachingPolicy</i> interface, the <i>ICache</i> interface implements the semantics of
the data cache, itself. The <i>AccessOrderedCache</i> is a bounded cache that attempts to maintain an upper
bound on the cached data. The upper bound cannot be maintained, however, in the case that bound XPath 
expressions access more data than will fit in the cache. In this case the cache grows. However, as soon as 
those expressions are unbound, the cache will shrink.
</p>

<h4><a name="Performance">Performance</a></h4>
<p>The XModel framework was designed from the beginning with performance as a 
  high-priority. The choice of data-structures has been evaluated for key mechanisms. Space is 
  generally traded for speed but it is possible to customize the framework to optimize for space.
</p>   

<p>There is overhead when listeners are bound to XPath expressions. However, in many 
  cases this overhead is minimal even for large datamodels. Consider a model consisting of a 
  library of millions of books and the following expression:
</p>

<p class="code">collection('library')/book</p>

<p>When this expression is bound, the listener will receive notification consisting of a Java <i>List</i> 
   object with an entry for each book, which is practical. However, if a predicate is added to the expression:
</p>   
   
<p class="code">collection('library')/book[ title = 'The Two Towers']</p>   

<p>then binding a listener could become very expensive since the listener should be 
  updated if the title of any book in the library is changed to 'The Two Towers'. This is not the 
  behavior that we want. The XModel framework defines a custom xpath function, <i>static()</i>, 
  which tells the framework that part of an expression never changes. The <i>static()</i> function 
  takes a single argument and returns the result of that argument. The query above could be written 
  efficiently as follows:
</p>

<p class="code">collection('library')/book[ static( title = 'The Two Towers')]</p>   

<p>When bound this expression will notify the listener whenever a book entitled, 'The 
  Two Towers', is added or removed from the library. The expression will not, however, notify the 
  listener if the title of a book becomes (or ceases to be) 'The Two Towers', which is the desired 
  behavior.
</p>   

<h3><a name="Interfaces"><i>Interfaces</i></a></h3>
<h4><a name="IModelObject"><i>IModelObject</i></a></h4>
<p>The <i>IModelObject</i> interface defines the operations on a node of the hierarchical 
  data-model. It supports one parent, zero or more children and zero or more attributes. The 
  attributes of an IModelObject form an unordered set of mappings between a string key (the 
  attribute name) and a java Object (the attribute value). The parent and children of an 
  IModelObject are instances of IModelObject, and the children are ordered. For legacy reasons, the 
  element "name" as defined by the XML 1.0 specification is obtained by calling the 
  <i>IModelObject.getType()</i> method, and <i>type</i> will be used throughout this document. The 
  XPath 1.0 <i>name()</i> function returns the type.
</p>   

<p>There are two attributes which are treated specially by IModelObject implementations: the 
  <i>id</i> attribute and the empty attribute. The attribute whose name is the empty string is the 
  value of the object (text node). In DOM, attributes and text nodes are always objects. The 
  <i>ModelObject</i> reference implementation of the <i>IModelObject</i> interface treats 
  attributes as key/value mappings and delegates the storage semantics to the implementation. 
  However, every implementation must be able to render an attribute as an <i>AttributeNode</i>. An 
  <i>AttributeNode</i> is an <i>IModelObject</i> whose type is the attribute key and whose value is 
  the attribute value. Clients generally never need to access <i>AttributeNodes</i> and there use 
  is discouraged. <i>AttributeNodes</i> are used internally by the listener framework.
</p>   

<p>The value of an attribute is always a Java <i>Object</i> which allows arbitrary information to 
  be associated with data in the model. If a Java <i>Object</i> which is the value of an attribute 
  implements the <i>toString()</i> method, then that part of the model can be rendered to XML. Keep 
  in mind that the framework does not provide an automated mechanism for deserializing associations 
  when a model is being constructed from an XML document.
</p>   

<p>The <i>Xlate</i> class provides a collection of static convenience methods for 
  getting and setting attributes to and from Java primitive types like <i>double</i>. The 
  following code uses the <i>Xlate</i> class to get the number of pages of a book element:
</p>   
  
<p class="code">Xlate.childGet( book, "pageCount", 0)</p>   

<p>The zero argument is the default value if the <i>pageCount</i> element does not 
  exist and also serves to choose among the overloaded <i>Xlate.chileGet</i> methods. The default 
  value is used if the first argument is null.
</p>   

<p>The parent of an <i>IModelObject</i> is either an <i>IModelObject</i> or null. The 
  root of the model is an <i>IModelObject</i> whose parent is null. The framework supports the 
  XPath 2.0 <i>collection</i> method which provides access to the named collections of 
  root-nodes. All of the root nodes in a collection must have the same type.
</p>   

<p>The children of an <i>IModelObject</i> are ordered and are accessed as 
  <i>List&lt;IModelObject&gt;</i>. The descendants of an <i>IModelObject</i> can be traversed using 
  the <i>BreadthFirstIterator</i>, <i>DepthFirstIterator</i>, or <i>NonSyncingIterator</i>.
</p>   

<p>The <i>IModelObject</i> interface provides methods for adding and removing 
  listeners. <i>IModelObject</i> implementations are required to perform notification to all 
  registered listeners whenever the parent, children or attributes of the object are modified. All 
  of the XModel listener mechanisms are implemented by adding and removing listeners on 
  <i>IModelObject</i> instances.
</p>

<h4><a name="Example 1"></a>Example 1</h4>
<p>The following code loads an XML file, creates a collection to hold the root element
  and then transforms the file back into xml:
</p>

<pre>
public static void main( String[] args) throws Exception
{
  if ( args.length &lt; 1)
  {
    System.err.println( "usage: java Tutorial xml_file_name");
    System.exit( 1);
  }
  
  // create a model from an xml file
  XmlIO xmlIO = new XmlIO();
  IModelObject root = xmlIO.read( new FileInputStream( args[ 0]));
  ModelRegistry.getInstance().addRoot( "MyCollection", root);
  
  // accessing a collection
  IExpression accessCollectionExpr = XPath.createExpression( "collection( 'MyCollection')");
  List&lt;IModelObject&gt; result = accessCollectionExpr.evaluateNodes( NullContext.getInstance());
  IModelObject collectionRoot = (result.size() > 0)? result.get( 0): null;
  
  // transforming model to xml
  xmlIO.setOutputStyle( XmlIO.Style.printable);
  String xml = xmlIO.write( collectionRoot);
  System.out.println( xml);
}  
</pre>

<h4><a name="Example 2">Example 2</a></h4>
<p>The following code demonstrates complex querying with an XPath expression. XPath provides a succinct way to code 
   transformation logic which, if hand-coded in Java, would require considerably more code. In my experience, moving 
   complexity to an XPath expression often yields more readable code.
</p>
  
<pre>
ADD SOMETHING HERE!

<p>Since the data-model does not contain information about the original xml text formatting, the xml 
  generated by <i>XmlIO.write</i> method will be different from the original xml. For example, tags
  which are embedded in the text of their parents will be moved so that all the text appears together.
