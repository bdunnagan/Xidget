<!--
  A script that implements the conventions for compressing xidget configuration files into an application
  that can be deployed either stand-alone or in an applet.  There are two conventions:
  
    1. The xidget configuration files are stored in a folder named "xapp" at the root of the project.
    
    2. This script produces a compressed configuration file named "xapp.xip" that is known to the
       org.xidget.Creator class and is accessed by the org.xidget.swing.Main and Applet classes.
-->
<script>
  <create var="xapp">
    <xapp path="xapp">
      <extern:cache class="org.xidget.caching.FileSystemCachingPolicy"/>
    </xapp>
  </create>
  
  <fileSave file="'xapp.xip'" source="$xapp" mode="compressed" overwrite="true"/>
</script>
